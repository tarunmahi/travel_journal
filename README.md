<br/>React framework is the most rapidly developing
webframework in existence.

 props helps us in passing down data more effieciently and will reduce code by a number of instances.<br/>
 **props** are passed as **parameters in the function** where the parameters are called again as objects inside the function.    
 - `map function` in [React](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-the-map()-function-to-export-javascript-in-react)<br/>
